# An Etiquette For Minor Time Travel
### A Generative Poetry Experience Using Historical Datasets

Drawing on historical datasets created by the Alan Turing Institute's [*Living With Machines*](https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/) research project, this digital installation work recreates the 1850 rail journey between Penzance and London in real-time 3D. The audience takes the perspective of a rail passenger gazing out of the window at a landscape constructed as lines of poetry moving past the window as the train speeds up, slows down, visits stations and is beset by delays. This poetry is generated from both original corpora and those drawn from other historical datasets, using the [Tracery](http://tracery.io) library. 

**The project is designed as an installation work, but a standalone release for PC and Mac is forthcoming in 2025.**
