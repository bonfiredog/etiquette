v 1.7
* URP reinit fix
* new linear2Gamma parameter

v 1.6
* URP fix: wasnt able to render to color fmt (at least in play node) 
  ...render 1st float buffer then copy to final
  also possible in 6000 (compat mode)
* effect mask tex (0 effect 1 no effect)
  
v 1.5
* added URP support (some minor features missing)

v 1.4
* init Fade to 1.0 in HDRP
* adjustible outline color

v 1.3
* 3 modes: mode 0 -> best quality .. 2 -> lowest quality, fastest
* precaculated gradieents (mode 2)
* HDRP support (disabled by _rename_me suffix due to backwards compatibility)
* HDRP gamma correct (linear colorspace)
* fixed resize bug when "Mip Level" > 0

v 1.2
* fixed to work with OSX-metal
* input feature: texture as input instead of cam
* output feature: render to texture instead of screen

v 1.1
* optimized some code in coloredpencil.cginc
* added define "FASTER" for faster version (less quality) in coloredpencil.cginc
* added define "LESS_LOOPS" for less loops (maybe some platforms dont support 3 nested loops?) in coloredpencil.cginc
  - unfortunately reverts some optimizations from above
* renamed youSpinMeRiseRound to youSpinMeRiseRound_ColoredPencils.cs
  (so no conflicts with other effects)
